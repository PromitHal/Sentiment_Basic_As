# Sentiment Analysis of IRCTC App Reviews 
***Sentiment Classification***

Binary Classification:
 if score<=2 : class=0
 if score>2 : class=1
1. Sentiment_ Different Models: Here, I have implemented various classical models for sentiment classification. Both binary and multiclass classification have been implemented. However, binary classification worked best.
2. Sentiment_LIVE: Live predictions via LSTM model.
